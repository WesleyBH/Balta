# 🎓 Balta.io Lessons

This repository contains projects that I've developed while following the courses on balta.io. The projects are primarily console and web applications written in C#.

## 📂 Projects

1. **Console Calculator** 🧮: A simple console application that performs basic arithmetic operations. The user can choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Stopwatch Timer App** ⏱️: A console application that functions as a stopwatch or a timer. The user can set the time in seconds or minutes, and the application will count up (for the stopwatch) or down (for the timer). When the time is up, the application will beep to alert the user.

## 🚀 How to Use

To run any of the projects, clone this repository and open the desired project in an IDE that supports C#, such as Visual Studio. Then, you can run the project from the IDE.
